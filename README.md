Basic JavaScript quiz with Bootstrap elements

The purpose of this quiz is to successfully implement JavaScript/jQuery into a basic HTML file. 
In addition, this project also displays the interactive quiz questions one at a time, with fade animations.

Tools used:
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery

Although this is a beginner project, it exemplifies the successful use of most basic front-end development tools.
Design is not the focus, and some elements in the page do not blend perfectly together. However, this will be resolved in the
future. 

I am open for any tips, contribution, or feedback in general.

Otherwise, enjoy this 5-question quiz, and test your star knowledge!
